# üîé High-level observations

- **Good stuff**: You‚Äôre using JWTs, HTTPOnly/SameSite cookies, and bearer tokens. You‚Äôre distinguishing between browser and CLI clients. You‚Äôve got clear response codes and security tags in place ‚Äî so the skeleton looks solid.
- **Where I‚Äôd dig deeper**: The doc focuses on *what endpoints do*, but not *how security is enforced*. Most vulnerabilities will hinge on *implementation details* (e.g., token storage, validation, database checks, and update logic).

***

## üîê Security review points

### 1. **Authentication \& Token Handling**

- **JWT storage**:
    - For `/auth/browser`, you mention HTTPOnly, Secure, SameSite. üëç Good! But: are you rotating tokens? What‚Äôs the expiry time? Short-lived access tokens + refresh tokens are best.
    - For `/auth/cli`, client manages the JWT manually. Risk: developers might store tokens in plaintext config files, environment vars, or history. Might want to think about guidance or limiting scope.
- **Logout / Revocation**:
    - Commented out `/jwt/invalidate` and `/jwt/refresh` endpoints. Without these, users can‚Äôt easily revoke stolen tokens ‚Üí risk of *long-lived compromise*. Think about how you‚Äôd handle token invalidation (blacklist, DB, short TTL, etc).
- **Multiple auth methods (bearer + cookie)**:
    - Might double your attack surface: make sure both paths validate claims *identically*. For example, cookie-based and bearer-based should hit the same middleware, or you risk discrepancies.

***

### 2. **Authorization**

- Most endpoints seem to return *data tied to the authenticated user*. The doc says, for example, ‚Äúserver determines which account to delete based on JWT‚Äù.
‚Üí Challenge: are you trusting *just the JWT claims* (like `sub: userId`)? If so, could someone forge a token or manipulate it?
    - Learn: *JWT signature validation*, *audience/issuer checks*, *enforcing subject field*.
- `/users/{id}` is public ‚Äî good, but ensure only safe ‚Äúpublic‚Äù fields are exposed. You don‚Äôt want email addresses, internal IDs, or security metadata leaking.
    - Learn: *endpoint data over-exposure (OWASP API Security \#3: Excessive Data Exposure)*
- `/user/settings` (PATCH): classic risk: users updating unauthorized fields (e.g., escalating roles by PATCHing `role=admin`).
    - Learn: *mass assignment vulnerability*, *JSON Patch validation*.

***

### 3. **Account Management**

- **Account deletion (`DELETE /account`)**:
    - You‚Äôre requiring credentials in requestBody *and* JWT auth. That‚Äôs unusual ‚Äî normally, JWT auth alone identifies the user. Is the extra credential check intentional, or is it redundant/confusing?
    - Attack surface: *Weak double validation* ‚Üí if either the JWT verification or credential check is flawed, deletion could be abused.
- **Account creation (`POST /account`)**:
    - Expect brute-force or scripted account creation. Need: rate limiting, captcha, or anti-abuse measures.
    - Also: passwords must be validated (length, complexity) and stored hashed with a strong algorithm (bcrypt, argon2).

***

### 4. **Friends \& User Data**

- `/user/friends`:
    - Needs strong access control ‚Üí make sure you‚Äôre returning only the authenticated user‚Äôs friends, never others‚Äô lists. Otherwise, a misconfigured token check could expose social graphs.
- `/users/{id}`:
    - Remember enumeration attacks. If user IDs follow predictable patterns (incremental IDs, usernames), attackers can scrape your entire user directory. Mitigation: rate limit, monitoring, maybe require auth to slow it down.

***

### 5. **Transport \& Networking**

- Nothing in the spec mandates HTTPS/TLS. You should assume all communication *must* be over TLS. Tokens or cookies over HTTP = instant leakage.
    - Learn: *TLS enforcement, HSTS headers*.

## üß† Concepts to go research

If I were mentoring you, I‚Äôd point you to dig into:

1. **JWT best practices**: expiration, refresh tokens, signature validation, blacklisting.
2. **Session management**: token invalidation, replay attack prevention.
3. **Authorization design**: enforce owner-only access, validate fields in PATCH requests, avoid mass assignment.
4. **OWASP API Top 10** (2023): in particular API1 (Broken Authentication), API2 (Broken Authorization), API3 (Excessive Data Exposure), API4 (Lack of Resource Rate Limiting), API6 (Mass Assignment).
5. **Rate limiting \& abuse prevention** for account creation, login, and public profile scraping.
6. **Cryptography**: how JWTs are signed (HS256 vs RS256 vs ES256), why key rotation matters.
7. **Error handling**: avoid leaking whether accounts exist (user enumeration via "404 vs 401" on login/register).
8. **Patch request handling**: study JSON Patch vulnerabilities, ensure fine-grained field validation.

***

‚úÖ **Final feedback, like I would give an intern**:
The API spec shows a clear structure and awareness of core security patterns (JWT, secure cookies). That‚Äôs *great*! But the *real risk areas* are:

- ensuring JWTs are short-lived and revocable
- preventing privilege escalation in PATCH and DELETE endpoints
- controlling data exposure (especially with public endpoints like `/users/{id}`)
- rate limiting and abuse protection

You‚Äôve laid the groundwork ‚Äî now deepen your knowledge in those attack vectors. Think like an attacker: if I had a token, how could I abuse it? If I didn‚Äôt have one, how could I get data anyway?
