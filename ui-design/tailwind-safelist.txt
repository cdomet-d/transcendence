/!\ INFO /!\

Tailwind CSS only compiles classes that are present in the source code at build 
time. Those are dynamic classes that Tailwind doesn't recognize because 
they look like that: 

> el.classList.add(`bg-[${option.content}]`)

Declaring them here forces Tailwind to include them in the compiled styles file, 
avoiding issues.
